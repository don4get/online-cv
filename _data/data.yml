    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Technology enthusiast, I enjoy working on complex problems involving physics and programming. 

education:
    - degree: MSc in Aeronautic Engineering
      university: ISAE-SUPAERO, Toulouse, France.
      time: 2012 - 2014
      details: |
        During my years in this institute, I fueled my passion for everything able to fly. 
        I obtained my Private Pilot License, thanks to funds from the University. 
        I also joined the Micro-UAV club where I learnt how to make my own quadcopter, spending so many nights trying to 
        control it properly.
        These sides projects helped me to establish a clear sense of the high quality courses I was taught. 
        During the second year, I specialized in automatics and left for a double degree in Milan.

    - degree: MSc in Control System Design
      university: Politecnico di Milano
      time: 2014 - 2016

experiences:
    - role: System Engineer
      time: Aug 2017 - Present
      company: senseFly, Cheseaux-sur-Lausanne, Switzerland
      link: https://www.sensefly.com/
      details: |
        During my two years as a control systems engineer and developer, I had the unique opportunity to get involved 
        in the development of the new eBeeX. In particular, I was responsible to stabilize 
        its flight during the early stage of the project. During this stage I learnt a lot in embedded programming, as well as
        in data analysis.  
        After that I managed to give some help to improve our code quality, improving code architecture and 
        working on some continuous integrations improvements.

    - role: Consulting engineer
      time: Jan 2017 - Aug 2017
      company: Dassault Aviation, Istres, France
      link: https://www.dassault-aviation.com/
      details: |
        I gave my help to organize and manage electric ground tests on three test campaigns. After these tests, I was in charge 
        of analyzing measured data and produced some reports resuming my analysis.

    intro: >
      I started getting involved in some projects aiming to improve signal processing and control theory support in Python
    assignments:
      - title: python-control
        link: https://github.com/python-control/python-control
        tagline: |
          I got involved in the development in the python control library towards the end of the 2018.
          This library is a concrete alternative the Control Toolbox from Matlab, in order to design systems control laws.
          I helped the main development team comply with pep recommendations and suggested some features to improve robustness and testability 
          in the library.

        tagline: |
          I am currently helping with the development of this new Python library for system identification. 
          Its main goal is to provide a valid alternative to the system identification toolbox of Matlab.
      
      - title: limbo
        link: https://github.com/don4get/limbo
        tagline: |
          I wrote a small UAV simulator in python, starting from a deprecated OSS project.
          This project is functional and allows to design control laws for small fixedwing UAVs.

      - title: hummingbird
        link: https://github.com/don4get/hummingbird
        tagline: |
          Fresh restart of the previous project limbo, given that Pr. R. Beard created dedicated templates to create a simulator
          for fixedwing UAVs.
          My goal is to provide support for system identification and MIMO control in the simulator.
