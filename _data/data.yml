        During my years in this institute, I fueled my passion for everything able to fly. 
        I obtained my Private Pilote License, thanks to funds from the University. 
        I also joined the Micro-UAV club where I learnt how to make my own quadcopter, spending so many nights trying to control it properly.
        These sides projects helped me to establish a clear sense of the high quality courses I was taught. 
        During the second year, I specialized in automatics and left for a double degree in Milano.

          "I got involved in the development in the python control library towards the end of the 2018.
          This library is a concrete alternative the Control Toolbox from Matlab, in order to design systems control laws.
          I helped the main development team comply with pep recommandations and suggested some features to improve robustness and testability 
          in the library."
